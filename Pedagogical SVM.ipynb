    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a simple but reasonably standard use of the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. For better or worse, the mathematical details behind this algorithm are beyond the technical background required of this notebook's audience. The mathematically sophisticated (or simply adventurous) student can visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine to see a more exact treatment of what the algorithm does, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization for a glimpse of exactly how and why it works.\n",

    "We begin with a (fictional) dataset describing 300 young basketball players. The first two columns gives each player's height in inches and 100m sprint time in seconds, as measured during their senior year season. The third column indicates whether each player did (1) or did not (0) end up playing basketball on a college team. We think of height and sprint times as predictive variables and college playing as an output to be predicted, and we will end up with an algorithm that predicts just that.\n",
